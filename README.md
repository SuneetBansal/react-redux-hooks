## How to use

### Basic usage

### Local Setup

`npm run start` (**port**: 3000)

### PROD Setup

`npm run build` (It would create prod files under build folder)

### Customizing Semantic UI

To customize Semantic UI you can find the appropriate files in `src/styling/theme`. To understand the file structure provided in that folder, please read the [Customization Guide](http://learnsemantic.com/developing/customizing.html) provided by Semantic UI.

The theme files are pre-filled with all available variables so you can just set them and forget them. As you save those files Webpack will automatically rec-compile your files.
